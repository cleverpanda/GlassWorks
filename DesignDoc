-----TO-DO-----
Soul Glass
	dark and collision when unpowered, clear and can walk through when powered
	colored soul glass allows for multiplayer scoreboard team interaction
glass slabs
	fancy and vanilla
lanterns
	oil lantern, can refill with oil, can extinguish and relight
	Candle Lantern, can refill with new candle
	take redstone signals to relight when in block form
Oil Lamp
	extinguishes faster than Lantern
	cannot place on cielings 
	//what about walls?
lantern carts and boats
	renders lantern in minecart
 	moving light source
	must start with a full lantern, but wont use fuel
tar pools
	need BOP support
	dont generate correctly
	could have better shapes generated
Redstone Bulb
	like a torch but controlled by redstone
	//too unoriginal?
	//would be good for more modern builds though
	//wouldnt extinguish...
	//maybe needs power with IE installed
Glass Doors

Extinguishing mechanic
	Falling into water with lantern,lamp,torch extinguishes it
		torch extinguish -> return sticks //need to be aware that some mods add this too
	Falling into water with molten glass returns glass blocks
	
molten glass burns you without protection?
	//too much hastle?
	//wouldnt need apron then
	//maybe wait for IW then tie in
dropping glass items from too high will shatter them
	//too much hastle?
Potion Flask made by enchanting unfinished #2 potion flask
	//Lore: the magic makes the glass retain the potions potency better
	30 levels
	no books+anvil allowed
	
fish bowl block? :)

blowpipe vuvuzela XD

using blowpipe makes player hold it up to mouth

model for blowpipe

seaweed loot chance from fishing 

lang file

//how should colors be handled?, currently externally by vanilla

glass cutter in hand needs to be rotated

spyglass 
	X2,X3 magnification
	with 2 lenses and gold nuggets
	use gold plate if availible

config system
	also importing blowpipe recipe entries from config
	
soul glass should have config to allow arrows,snowballs,tnt entity to pass through to prevent super forcefield

need a more involved mid-end game recipe for soul glass

blast glass texture too unoriginal or does it stay faithful?

lamps,lanterns need to actually process fuel

mixing flask
	(mix two potions to get 2 (or 3?) doses of the combined effects in one bottle
	texture //call Alvoria again?
	rendering // how to do 2 potion overlays in one file?
	needs end game crafting recipe to justify
	
use glass lens to start fires?
	//def would be a config option if implemented
	//too easy for fire?
	//only during day
seaweed generation is meh.

more creative way to create lamp oil than smelting tar?

might be a good idea to make lamp oil an actual fluid

go back and make sure all reasonable things support ore dict

allow shift clicking into blowpipe slot

tar needs it's own particle. 
	a slow bubbling that pops on the surface
	
crystal glass should require lead powder when availible 

soul glass opacity and redstone functions

blow pipe should be crafted with iron nuggets or iron plates if availible




-----BUGS-----
being incased in tar renders water overlay

being inside soul glass doesnt render the glass at all

oil lamp model has no texture

placing oil lamp adjacent to another oil lamp borks
	placing ANYTHING next to it borks
	
placing lantern on top of lantern pops off when it should really just deny the placement

lantern block should rotate based on player position when placed on ground

sould glass item does not render 

seaweed adjacent to a solid block pops off on update
	how to determine if its actually underwater or if someone is just making a pillar of water above ground and trying to put seaweed in it?



-----Tie Ins-----
Flour+Swamp Tar == Swamp Paste //counts as glue for MTS

Glenn's Gasses //Trent may add explicit support. ask again when closer
	lamps explode gas
	lanterns are gas safe
Beehives
	candles can be placed in lanterns
Quark glass shards
	melt them into molten glass.
	just disregard color
lamp oil needs to be distilled with IE installed

lanterns,lamps with dynamic lights

lamp posts with IW and SW

Decay
	molten glass + Time -> Glass Block
	molten glass burns chests
		//what about with Iron chests installed?
Tinker's?
	//egh maybe post beta release
	
potash from pine 2x and maple, oak with VT
