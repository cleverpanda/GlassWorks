-----TO-DO- MAIN-----
Soul Glass
	dark and collision when unpowered, clear and can walk through when powered
	colored soul glass allows for multiplayer scoreboard team interaction
glass slabs
	fancy and vanilla
lanterns
	oil lantern, can refill with oil, can extinguish and relight
	Candle Lantern, can refill with new candle
	take redstone signals to relight when in block form
Oil Lamp
	extinguishes faster than Lantern

lantern carts and boats
	renders lantern in minecart
 	moving light source
	must start with a full lantern, but wont use fuel
tar pools
	need BOP support
	dont generate correctly
	could have better shapes generated
Redstone Bulb
	like a torch but controlled by redstone
	//too unoriginal?
	//feature creep?
	//would be good for more modern builds though
	//wouldnt extinguish...
	//maybe needs power with IE installed
Glass Door

glasscutter world interaction needs to be redone
	
Extinguishing mechanic
	Falling into water with lantern,lamp,torch extinguishes it
		torch extinguish -> return sticks //need to be aware that some mods add this too
	Falling into water with molten glass returns glass blocks
	
molten glass burns you without protection?
	//too much hastle?
	//wouldn't need apron if no
	//maybe wait for IW then tie in
dropping glass items from too high will shatter them
	//too much hastle?

using blowpipe makes player hold it up to mouth

seaweed junk loot chance from fishing 

lang file

retrieveing soul glass should require enchanted glasscutter?

sounds for soul glass

how should coloring glass be handled?
	currently externally by vanilla

config system
	also importing blowpipe recipe entries from config for modpack makers
	
soul glass should have config to allow arrows,snowballs,tnt entity, etc. to pass through to prevent super forcefield

need a more involved mid-end game recipe for soul glass?

lamps,lanterns need to actually process fuel
	make it an optional config

mixing flask
	(mix two potions to get 4 doses of the combined effects in one bottle
	texture //call Alvoria again?
	rendering // how to do 2 potion overlays in one file?
	needs end game crafting recipe to justify
			dragon?
	
soul glass opacity and redstone functions

add blast glass pane
	little less blast resistance
	
	
-----TO-DO-SMALL-STUFF-----
use glass lens to start fires?
	//def would be a config option if implemented
	//too easy for fire?
	//only during day
	
fix recipe for glasscutter, looks weird with stick angle

crystal glass should require lead powder when availible 

blow pipe should be crafted with iron nuggets or iron plates if availible

go back and make sure all reasonable things support ore dict

might be a good idea to make lamp oil an actual fluid

more creative way to create lamp oil than smelting tar?

allow shift clicking into blowpipe slot

tar needs it's own particle. 
	a slow bubbling that pops on the surface

make seaweed gen less lame

is blast glass texture too unoriginal or does it stay faithful?

spyglass 
	fix 3rd person rotation
	use gold plate if availible

glass cutter in hand needs to be rotated

soul glass connected textures

fish bowl block? :)

blowpipe easter egg


-----BUGS-----
being incased in tar renders water overlay

being inside soul glass doesnt render the glass at all

oil lamp model has no texture

lantern block should rotate based on player position when placed on ground

spyglass 
	overlay does not center properly
	
lanterns and lamps need to stack to 16

tar bucket is consumed when using as fuel

-----Tie Ins-----
Flour+Swamp Tar == Swamp Paste //counts as glue for MTS

Glenn's Gasses //Trent may add explicit support. ask again when closer
	lamps explode gas
	lanterns are gas safe
Beehives
	candles can be placed in lanterns
Quark glass shards
	melt them into molten glass.
	just disregard color
lamp oil needs to be distilled with IE installed

lanterns,lamps with dynamic lights

lamp posts with IW and SW

Decay
	molten glass + Time -> Glass Block
	molten glass burns chests
		//what about with Iron chests installed?
Tinker's?
	//egh maybe post beta release
	
potash from pine (2),maple,oak with VT
